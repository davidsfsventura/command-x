Command X Free
A free macOS menu bar utility that brings Windows-style cut/paste functionality to Finder.

Overview
Command X Free adds the familiar Windows cut/paste behavior to macOS Finder, allowing you to use Cmd+X to cut files and Cmd+V to move them to a new location. This eliminates the need to remember the awkward Option+Cmd+V shortcut that macOS uses for moving files.

Features
Windows-like Cut/Paste: Use Cmd+X to cut files and Cmd+V to paste/move them
Finder Integration: Works seamlessly with macOS Finder
Menu Bar Icon: Lightweight menu bar utility with scissors icon
Hide/Show Option: Toggle menu bar icon visibility with Cmd+Shift+X or through the menu
Auto-launch Support: Can be set to start automatically at login
Accessibility Permissions: Securely monitors keyboard events only when Finder is active
Why This App?
The only similar app on the Mac App Store costs $4, but file management should be free and accessible to everyone. This open-source alternative provides the same functionality at no cost.

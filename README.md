# Command X Free

**A free macOS menu bar utility that brings Windows-style cut/paste functionality to Finder.**

## Overview

Command X Free adds the familiar Windows cut/paste behavior to macOS Finder, allowing you to use `Cmd+X` to cut files and `Cmd+V` to move them to a new location. This eliminates the need to remember the awkward `Option+Cmd+V` shortcut that macOS uses for moving files.

## Features

- **Windows-like Cut/Paste**: Use `Cmd+X` to cut files and `Cmd+V` to paste/move them
- **Finder Integration**: Works seamlessly with macOS Finder
- **Menu Bar Icon**: Lightweight menu bar utility with scissors icon
- **Hide/Show Option**: Toggle menu bar icon visibility with `Cmd+Shift+X` or through the menu
- **Auto-launch Support**: Can be set to start automatically at login
- **Accessibility Permissions**: Securely monitors keyboard events only when Finder is active

## Why This App?

The only similar app on the Mac App Store costs $4, but file management should be free and accessible to everyone. This open-source alternative provides the same functionality at no cost.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the Releases page
2. Move the app to your Applications folder
3. Run the app and grant accessibility permissions when prompted
4. Look for the scissors icon in your menu bar - you're ready to go!

## Usage

1. Select files in Finder
2. Press `Cmd+X` to cut (copies files and marks them for moving)

4. Press `Cmd+V` to paste/move the files

## Version 2.0 Features
